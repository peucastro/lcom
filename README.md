## The game
Our LCOM project is a replica of the popular video game Bomberman, with one little caveat in comparison with the original version of the game: the door that gets the player to the next level is hidden behind one of the walls, so the player must find it first by breaking the walls.

## Controls
The game controls are as follows:
- Arrows/WASD to move in each direction and switch between menu options (yes, A and D can switch between menu options);
- Space to drop bomb;
- Enter/Esc to pause;
- Enter to select a menu option.
The mouse can optionally be used to drop bombs in a position around you (diagonally included) and to select menu options.
