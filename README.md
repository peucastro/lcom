## The game
Our LCOM project is a replica of the popular video game Bomberman.

The goal is to defeat all the enemies on the board by dropping bombs that hit them. These bombs can also destroy some of the walls, and behind one of them is a door that gets the player to the next level once all enemies are dealt with. Each defeated enemy adds 100 points to the playerâ€™s score and each destroyed wall adds 10.

The dropped bombs can also hit the player, who starts with 3 lives, and there may be extra lives somewhere on the board.

## Controls
The game controls are as follows:
- Arrows/WASD to move in each direction and switch between menu options (yes, A and D can switch between menu options);
- Space to drop bomb;
- Enter/Esc to pause;
- Enter to select a menu option.
The mouse can optionally be used to drop bombs in a position around you (diagonally included) and to select menu options.
